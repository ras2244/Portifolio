1. Explain what virtual functions are. 
a. Virtual functions are functions example of polymorphism where the polymorphic object can change its type throughout its lifetime if the type belongs to the inheritance hierarchy.
2. What is the difference between virtual and pure virtual? 
a. Virtual functions have their implementation, while pure virtual does not have. Their implementation belongs to child classes.

Example: pickupCar and sportCar are responsible to implement pure virtual functions prototyped in Vehicle.

3. What are abstract classes and interfaces? 
a. A class that have at least one pure virtual function is known as abstract class. While a class which all functions are pure virtual is known as interface, which means that this class does not have any implementation.
Examples: Vehicle function represents an interface because all functions are all pure virtual functions.

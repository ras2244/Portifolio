	*		--------------- The reason for creating this template-------------
	*
	*	This template is created to store acf values within wordpress.
	*
	*	This page will be used by all the pages that require a drop down on mobile view
	*
	*	No template deisgn or structure is needed for this reason.
	*
	*	
	*		--------------- How it works -------------
	*
	*	There are 2 ACFs; 'select_mobile_header' & 'mobile_header_info'
	*
	*	'mobile_header_info' is used only on this template. 
	*		-the ACF will hold the value(s).
	*
	*	'select_mobile_header'
	*		-the page that needs the dropdown to appear
	*		-displays the drop down
	*		
	*
	*	Firstly a page is created to hold the values. page name eg:- 'mobile_dropdown_XX'
	*		-the page will have this template so the ACFs will be available
	*		-attach the necassary pages on the ACF value
	*
	*	Secondly, the page that needs the dropdown. eg:- 'about us'
	*		-tick 'has mobile header title'
	*		-select the page that was created for holding the ACF value. eg:- 'mobile_dropdown_XX'
	*		-the header title dropdown will appear on the page
